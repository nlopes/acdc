= Nested List with Parent Continuation

This tests that explicit continuations (+) after nested lists attach to the parent item, not the last nested item.

== Pattern from BreakingChanges.adoc

This is the exact pattern causing issues:

* Parent item with text that spans multiple lines. The content
  continues here:
+
  ** Nested item 1 with text
  ** Nested item 2 with text
  ** Nested item 3 with text
+
This paragraph should attach to parent, not "Nested item 3".
+
--
. Step one
. Step two
. Step three
--
+
Another paragraph that should attach to parent.
