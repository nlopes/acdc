This paragraph has _constrained italic_ text that requires word boundaries.

It works at the _beginning_ and at the _end_.

But not in the_middle_of words without boundaries.

**Unconstrained bold with _nested constrained italic_ inside**.

Edge cases: _word_.punctuation and _word_,comma and _word_!exclamation.

Multiple words: _multiple word italic phrase_ with spaces.

Mixed: _italic_ and **bold** together.
