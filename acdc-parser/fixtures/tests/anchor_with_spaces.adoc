= Anchor with Spaces Test

IDs with spaces are not valid per HTML5 spec.
The anchor syntax should not match, treating the text as literal content.

[[my section id]]
== Section with Space in Anchor

This section's anchor has spaces, so it should NOT be parsed as an anchor.
Instead, the [[...]] should become literal text in the preamble.

[#another space id]
== Section with Space in Shorthand

Same behavior for shorthand syntax with spaces.

[[valid-id]]
== Valid ID Section

This section has a valid ID without spaces.
