= Indented Plus Sign Test

This tests that indented `+` at start of a line is treated as literal text, not a hard line break.

== Valid hard line break

This text has a hard break +
and continues here.

== Indented plus (should be literal)

* Parent item
  +
  Indented text

== Multiple cases

Regular text +
with break.

But this:
  +
should be literal.
