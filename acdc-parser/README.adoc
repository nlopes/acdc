# `acdc-parser`

The implementation here follows from:

* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang/-/blob/main/spec/modules/ROOT/pages/lexicon.adoc[Language Lexicon]: nomenclature of elements
* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang/-/blob/main/spec/outline.adoc[Language Outline]: behaviour/layout
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest[Asciidoctor Language Documentation]: behaviour/layout

NOTE: I took a few of the grammar rules from https://github.com/kober-systems/literate_programming_toolsuite/blob/master/asciidoctrine/src/reader/asciidoc.pest[here] - some were already a perfect match to what I had, others I adapted, others I had in different forms and simplified. Credit where credit is due!
