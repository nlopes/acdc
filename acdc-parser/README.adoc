# `acdc-parser`

The implementation here follows from:

* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang/-/blob/main/spec/modules/ROOT/pages/lexicon.adoc[Lexicon]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest[AsciiDoc Language Documentation]

I'll try to keep as close as possible to:

* the nomenclature of elements in the grammar by following the https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang/-/blob/main/spec/modules/ROOT/pages/lexicon.adoc[Lexicon]
* the behaviour/layout as described in the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest[AsciiDoc Language Documentation]

WARNING: I don't yet follow the format of the ASG as described https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang/-/tree/main/asg?ref_type=heads[here].

NOTE: I took a few of the grammar rules from https://github.com/kober-systems/literate_programming_toolsuite/blob/master/asciidoctrine/src/reader/asciidoc.pest[here] - some were already a perfect match to what I had, others I adapted, others I had in different forms and simplified. Credit where credit is due!
