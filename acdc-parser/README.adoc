## Lists - detailed support notes

Lists are partially implemented. Here's what works and what doesn't.

### What works

**Ordered and unordered lists**

Basic list items with inline content work fine, including:

- Nested lists (using different marker levels like `*`, `**`, `***`)
- Checklist items (`[x]`, `[ ]`)
- Multiline text that wraps within a list item

**Description lists**

I've implemented basic description list support with several features:

- All standard delimiters (`::`, `:::`, `::::`, `;;`)
- Principal text (inline text immediately after the delimiter)
- Explicit continuation (`+`) for attaching block content
- Auto-attaching ordered/unordered lists to description list items (even with blank lines before the list)

### What doesn't work

**Multiple list continuations**

Single `+` continuation now works for attaching blocks to list items:

```asciidoc
* List item text
+
----
Block content here
----
* Next item (stays in same list)
```

However, multiple consecutive `+` continuations in the same item don't work correctly yet:

```asciidoc
* Item
+
Paragraph 1
+
Paragraph 2   <-- This doesn't attach properly
```

**List separators**

The https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/separating/[spec describes] two ways to force separate lists:

1. Line comment separator (`//`)
2. Block attribute separator (`[]`)

I don't support either. Lists with the same marker will always join together.

**Description list limitations**

While basic description lists work, there are gaps:

- No support for the experimental `[ordered]` and `[unordered]` attributes (https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/description-with-marker/[described here])
- No `.stack` role support for formatting

**Other missing list features**

- No support for `{empty}` to drop principal text
- No open block (`--`) wrapper support for grouping multiple blocks
- No ancestor list continuation (attaching blocks to parent list items with blank lines before `+`)

### Why these limitations exist

The model now supports block attachments (`ListItem` has both `principal: Vec<InlineNode>` and `blocks: Vec<Block>`), and single `+` continuations work. The remaining issues are parser grammar limitations:

1. Multiple consecutive `+` markers in the same item aren't parsed correctly
2. List separators (`//` and `[]`) aren't recognized
3. Ancestor list continuation (blank line before `+`) isn't supported
