# `acdc-cli`

This is main binary for the command line processor. Think of it as the equivalent to the
`asciidoctor` tool.

## Usage

## Backends supported

Check `link:../backends/README.adoc[backends README] for details on each of the backends.

- `link:./acdc-html[html]`
- `link:./acdc-terminal[terminal]` (not built by default)
- `link:./acdc-tck[tck]` (not built by default)

If you so wish, you can build an optional backend like so:

```shell
$ cargo build --features terminal
```

Alternatively, you can build them all like so:

```shell
$ cargo build --all-features
```
